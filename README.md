## DREO Cloud adapter for ioBroker

Unofficial ioBroker adapter for selected DREO cloud-connected devices.

> This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by DREO.

## Current status

The adapter is under active development and intended for controlled testing.

Current beta release: `0.1.3-beta.1`.

The release is published on npm and uses `@mehrwiedu/dreo-api` `0.1.3`.
It has been validated with eight real devices across six DREO models.

Implemented:

- FamilyTree-based device discovery
- runtime discovery of newly available devices
- initial state loading
- live WebSocket updates
- automatic raw and friendly object creation
- dynamic read-only creation of newly observed raw keys
- bidirectional control of confirmed functions
- automatic session renewal and WebSocket reconnect
- effective friendly states
- central write acknowledgement and failure reconciliation

The adapter uses:

```text
@mehrwiedu/dreo-api 0.1.3
```

DREO protocol details and native command logic remain inside the SDK.

## Tested devices

| Model | Type | Quantity | Validated areas |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `DR-HCF007S` | Ceiling fan | 3 | Fan, modes, main light, brightness, color temperature, atmosphere light, timers, child lock and live updates |
| `DR-HCF001S` | Ceiling fan | 1 | Components without `poweron`, modes, timers and live updates |
| `DR-HPF002S` | Stand fan | 1 | Fan, modes, display, directional oscillation, independent axis angles and live updates |
| `DR-HHM001S` | Humidifier | 1 | Power, modes, fog level, target humidity, indicators, filter state, operating information, timers and live updates |
| `DR-HHM003S` | Humidifier | 1 | Power, modes, fog level, target humidity, warm mist, indicator levels, humidity thresholds, filter state and live updates |
| `DR-HAP009S` | Air purifier | 1 | Power, modes, fan level, mood light, display, mute, child lock, power recovery, air quality, filter life and live updates |

Other devices may appear through raw states but are not automatically considered fully supported.

## Account setup

Use a DREO account that supports email/password login.

The adapter can use either the primary owner account or a separate secondary account with access to the DREO home.

Using a dedicated secondary account is recommended for adapter operation, but it is not required.

Apple and Google login are not supported.

## Configuration

- DREO email
- DREO password
- region: EU or US

The password is stored as an encrypted and protected ioBroker native setting.

## Object structure

```text
dreo-cloud.0.devices.<deviceId>
```

Possible branches:

```text
info
power
fan
humidifier
light.main
light.atmosphere
display
settings
timer
raw
```

The `raw` branch mirrors DREO values and is read-only.

## Supported controls

The exact set depends on the device.

Common controls include:

```text
power.on
fan.on
fan.speed
fan.mode
settings.mute
settings.childLock
light.main.on
light.main.brightness
light.main.colorTemperature
light.atmosphere.on
light.atmosphere.brightness
display.on
timer.*
```

Model-specific controls include:

```text
fan.oscillationMode
fan.oscillation.horizontalAngle
fan.oscillation.verticalAngle
humidifier.mode
humidifier.fogLevel
humidifier.autoTargetHumidity
humidifier.sleepTargetHumidity
humidifier.humidityIndicatorLowerThreshold
humidifier.humidityIndicatorUpperThreshold
humidifier.warmMist
light.mood.on
light.mood.level
display.level
airPurifier.mode
airPurifier.fanLevel
settings.powerRecovery
settings.filterInstalled
```

Read-only operating information includes filter life, operating hours, PM2.5 and air-quality level where reported.

## Write behavior

Writes are routed to public SDK methods.

- The adapter does not construct native DREO payloads.
- Identical successful writes are acknowledged immediately.
- Rejected writes are restored to the last confirmed value.
- Actual changes remain pending until confirmed by the device report where required.
- Failed DREO `control-reply` messages are surfaced as SDK errors.

## Deliberately unsupported

Ceiling-fan favorites based on raw `predefine` values are not writable.

Real-device testing showed that writing the slot did not execute the stored scene. Numeric writes were rejected by the cloud. `raw.predefine` therefore remains read-only.

Unverified fields such as `fixedconf` and additional RGB effects also remain raw-only.

## Cloud dependency

The adapter depends on private DREO cloud APIs and does not provide local-only control.

## Privacy and security

- Do not publish credentials, tokens, device serial numbers or unredacted logs.
- Prefer a dedicated secondary DREO account.
- Review logs before attaching them to issues.

## Known limitations

- Apple and Google login are not supported.
- Only EU and US regions are available.
- Not every raw state has a friendly mapping.
- Friendly structures are not yet generated when a known key first appears only after initialization.
- Partially shared homes/devices still require dedicated testing.
- DREO can change the private API without notice.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run check
npm run lint
npm run build
```
